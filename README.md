# Toronto Connection

Our project aims to help torontonian families better connect to the resources provided by the city, as well as to eachother.

The city of Toronto has a lot of data regarding child care but it is often difficult for parents, especially recent immigrants who may face  a language barrier, to find the information they need or even know what information they made need.

We've developped a simple web app which uses information about the user's location, work address, financial (with integration of the TD davinci API) and number of children in each age group to filter the city's child care center database and provide only relevant choices.
The system also determines if the user may be eligible for a child care fee subsidy and provides a link to further information. 

For connecting users to eachother, the communities section allows parents to connect with other parents with similar "characteristics". Users are able to join various discussion groups and organise events in their neighborhood.

The project was made as a proof of concept more than a full working product, with the idea of eventually adding functionality for other city data sets that could be relevant to parents and citizens in general.
