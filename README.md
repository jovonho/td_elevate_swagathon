# Toronto Connection

In the context of using technology to help connect communities both to resources and to eachother, our project aims to help families get access to relevant information in a convenient manner.

The city of Toronto has a lot of data regarding child care but it is often difficult for parents, especially recent immigrants who may face  alanguage barrier, to find the information they need or even know what information they made need.

With integration of the TD davinci API, we've developped a simple web app to serve parents with a relevant list of child care centers for them. We take into account financial information, both home and work addresses and number of children per age group to return the best choices available. 
From your financial data, we tell users if they may be eligible for a child care fee subsidy and provide links to further information. 


The project was made as a proof of concept and with the idea that the system should be highly modular and applicable to any kind of information which would enable families to connect to city resources and to eachother.
